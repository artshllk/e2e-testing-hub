          When I first started my journey in test automation, my toolset
          primarily was only Cypress. I started by writing very basic simple
          tests without knowing best practices to writing really complex test
          cases. During that time I was curious also about JavaScript and was
          learning on that part. After creating fundamental skills in JS, I had
          questions about Cypress like what you can test, how it works, and
          other questions. Cypress is known for its easy-to-use syntax and ideal
          for end-to-end testing. While Playwright feels similar, for a newcomer
          in this world, from my perspective, Cypress is easier than Playwright.

        <p className="mb-6">
          Cypress is an end-to-end testing framework designed to make testing
          modern web applications easier and more reliable. It allows developers
          and testers to write tests that interact with a web application just
          like a user would, entering text, navigating pages, and more. Cypress
          is popular for testing SPAs and supports testing front-end behavior,
          but it is limited to the browser environment (we will talk more about
          that later).

          Playwright is an open-source testing framework developed by Microsoft
          that allows automated testing of web applications across multiple
          browsers. Playwright supports all modern engines including Chromium,
          WebKit, and Firefox. It's super easy to install.

          During my time at my previous roles, I had the chance to develop
          strong skills in both Cypress and Playwright. In my first role,
          Cypress was already integrated with a few tests, and as a beginner, I
          found it easy to get started. Later, at my next company, Cypress had
          around 2000 tests integrated. Although Playwright wasnâ€™t fully
          integrated at that point, I took the initiative to learn and
          experiment with it, despite having limited prior experience.

          Playwright and Cypress are both powerful tools for end-to-end testing,

            <strong className="text-xl">Cross-Browser Support:</strong>
            <p>
              <strong>Playwright</strong> supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
              (Safari), offering extensive cross-browser testing capabilities.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-1">
              <strong>Cypress</strong>, while strong in Chromium-based browsers
              like Chrome and Edge, fully supports Firefox. However, WebKit
              support remains experimental. Cross-browser compatibility in
              Cypress requires the browsers to be installed locally, a condition
              that applies to Playwright as well.

              across multiple browsers, reducing test suite runtimes
              effectively. <strong>Cypress</strong> offers parallelization

              <strong>Playwright</strong>: Offers advanced network interception
              capabilities using <code>page.route()</code>. You can modify
              requests before they are sent to the server, such as changing HTTP
              methods, headers, or redirecting requests to mock services.
              Playwright also provides seamless mocking of responses directly in
              the request flow.

              <strong>Cypress</strong>: Allows request interception with{" "}
              <code>cy.intercept()</code> and supports pre-request modifications
              like altering headers, methods, or mocking responses. Cypress also
              enables redirecting requests to mock services. However, Playwright
              may offer slightly more granular control in some cases, especially
              for advanced scenarios involving dynamic routing. I will discuss
              this advanced control and dynamic routing in more detail in the
              next section.

              In some cases, Playwright offers more granular control, especially
              when dealing with advanced scenarios such as dynamic routing. You
              can conditionally modify requests and responses based on runtime
              data, URL parameters, or other dynamic factors. This flexibility

              flows. <strong>Cypress</strong>, however, lacks native multi-tab

            <p>
              Both frameworks support test isolation by default. The perception
              of weaker isolation in <strong>Cypress</strong> often stems from
              tester practices rather than the tool itself.

            <strong className="text-lg">Programming Language Support:</strong>
            <p>
              <strong>Cypress</strong> supports JavaScript and TypeScript, while{" "}
              <strong>Playwright</strong> extends its capabilities to additional
              languages, including Python, Java, and C#, making it a better
              choice for teams working in diverse language environments.

          <li>
            <strong className="text-lg">Debugging Tools:</strong>
            <p>
              <strong>Cypress</strong> simplifies debugging with its interactive
              Test Runner and time-travel snapshots. The <code>.debug()</code>{" "}
              command is particularly useful for inspecting the state during
              test execution.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Playwright</strong>, on the other hand, integrates deeply
              with tools like VS Code, providing powerful debugging options such
              as breakpoints and a trace viewer.

          Debugging
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Debugging in Cypress and Playwright offers different approaches. In
          Cypress, youâ€™re limited to using <code className="">.pause()</code> or
          <code>.debug()</code> on selected elements. When you use
          <code>.debug()</code>, Cypress will freeze the test and print the
          selector results in the Chrome console. You can then hover over the
          HTML element in Chrome to check if your selector is working.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          However, the issue is that you can only see the value for that
          particular line. You donâ€™t get access to any other states created by
          the test code. Adding breakpoints or using the{" "}
          <code className="">debugger</code> statement doesnâ€™t help much because
          Cypress runs all code first and handles the rest asynchronously. If
          you want to inspect async code, youâ€™d need to place the debugger
          inside a resolve function to make sure the code has finished. But even
          then, you can only see the value for that line, and you can't check
          the rest of the test state.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Another option is to use a third-party library like Promisify, which
          converts Cypressâ€™s async functionality into Promises. This allows you
          to add debugger statements after await to inspect variables that have
          been awaited. The problem with this approach is that Cypress wasnâ€™t
          designed to work with async/await, so you may run into issues. I tried
          this and faced several problems, so I switched back to using Cypress's
          built-in <code>.debug()</code> function.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Playwright, on the other hand, integrates well with Visual Studio Code
          and fully supports promises and async/await. You can debug your tests
          directly in VSCode, stop at any point, and check the state of any
          variable. It even highlights DOM elements in Chromium when you hover
          over a selector expression in VSCode (it works with multi-dot
          selectors too!).
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Playwright also has its own inspector where you can run tests step by
          step while watching them in Chromium. This allows you to evaluate
          selectors in real-time while the test is paused.

          Both tools are powerful, and the choice often depends on specific
          project needs. Cypress is ideal for simple to moderately complex web
          apps with a focus on ease of use and a strong developer experience.
          Playwright is better suited for more complex scenarios, especially if
          cross-browser testing, multi-page interactions, or deep network
          control are required.
