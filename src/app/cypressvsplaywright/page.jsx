          When I first started my journey in test automation, my toolset
          primarily was only Cypress. I started by writing very basic simple
          tests without knowing best practices to writing really complex test
          cases. During that time I was curious also about JavaScript and was
          learning on that part. After creating fundamental skills in JS, I had
          questions about Cypress like what you can test, how it works, and
          other questions. Cypress is known for its easy-to-use syntax and ideal
          for end-to-end testing. While Playwright feels similar, for a newcomer
          in this world, from my perspective, Cypress is easier than Playwright.

        <p className="mb-6">
          In this article, we'll compare Cypress and Playwright, two popular
          tools in end-to-end testing, by examining their key features, use
          cases, and performance. This comparison will help you decide which
          tool is the best fit for your testing needs

        <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-3xl font-extrabold mb-4">Cypress</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Cypress is an end-to-end testing framework designed to make testing
          modern web applications easier and more reliable. It allows developers
          and testers to write tests that interact with a web application just
          like a user wouldâ€”by clicking buttons, entering text, navigating
          pages, and more. Cypress is popular for testing SPAs and supports
          testing front-end behavior, but it is limited to the browser
          environment (we will talk more about that later).
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-extrabold mb-4 mt-10">Playwright</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Playwright is an open-source testing framework developed by Microsoft
          that allows automated testing of web applications across multiple
          browsers. Playwright supports all modern engines including Chromium,
          WebKit, and Firefox. It's super easy to install.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Now in both companies I've worked at, I had the luck to explore and
          learn good skills in both Cypress and Playwright. In one company,
          Cypress was already integrated with a few tests. As a beginner, it was
          pretty easy to use. Later, in the company I joined after, Cypress was
          integrated with around 2000 tests. Playwright was not fully
          integrated, so I started learning and playing around with it because I
          didn't have much experience working with it.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-extrabold mb-4">Key Differences</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          They are both popular tools for end-to-end testing, but they differ in
          terms of functionality, flexibility, and the use cases they support.
          Here are the key differences between the two:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-4 mb-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Cross-Browser Support:</strong> Cypress primarily focuses on
            testing within Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge) but
            supports Firefox and experimental WebKit. Playwright offers full
            cross-browser support, including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
            (Safari).
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Supported Platforms:</strong> Cypress mainly focuses on
            desktop web apps, while Playwright provides broader platform support
            including mobile browser emulation (Android, iOS) and different
            operating systems.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Speed and Performance:</strong> Playwright is optimized for
            parallelization and performance across multiple browsers, while
            Cypress may face performance limitations in larger test suites or
            different browser environments.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Network Interception and Control:</strong> Playwright
            provides deeper access to the network layer, making it more powerful
            for advanced use cases compared to Cypress.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Multi-Page and Frame Support:</strong> Playwright supports
            multi-page and iframe testing, while Cypress struggles with complex
            page interactions.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Debugging and Test Writing:</strong> Cypress allows you to
            view snapshots at each step, making debugging easier. Playwright
            provides better debugging for complex cases.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Community:</strong> Cypress has a larger community, making
            it easier to find solutions. Playwright's community is growing but
            newer in comparison.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Test Isolation:</strong> Playwright provides better test
            isolation while Cypress requires more effort to manage shared state
            between tests.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>CI/CD Integration:</strong> Both tools integrate well into
            CI/CD pipelines but Playwright's cross-browser support makes it more
            flexible for larger test suites.
          </li>
        </ol>

        {/* Debugging  */}

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-extrabold mb-4">Debugging</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Debugging in Cypress and Playwright offers different approaches. In
          Cypress, youâ€™re limited to using <code className="">.pause()</code> or
          <code>.debug()</code> on selected elements. When you use
          <code>.debug()</code>, Cypress will freeze the test and print the
          selector results in the Chrome console. You can then hover over the
          HTML element in Chrome to check if your selector is working.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          However, the issue is that you can only see the value for that
          particular line. You donâ€™t get access to any other states created by
          the test code. Adding breakpoints or using the{" "}
          <code className="">debugger</code> statement doesnâ€™t help much because
          Cypress runs all code first and handles the rest asynchronously. If
          you want to inspect async code, youâ€™d need to place the debugger
          inside a resolve function to make sure the code has finished. But even
          then, you can only see the value for that line, and you can't check
          the rest of the test state.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Another option is to use a third-party library like Promisify, which
          converts Cypressâ€™s async functionality into Promises. This allows you
          to add debugger statements after await to inspect variables that have
          been awaited. The problem with this approach is that Cypress wasnâ€™t
          designed to work with async/await, so you may run into issues. I tried
          this and faced several problems, so I switched back to using Cypress's
          built-in <code>.debug()</code> function.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Playwright, on the other hand, integrates well with Visual Studio Code
          and fully supports promises and async/await. You can debug your tests
          directly in VSCode, stop at any point, and check the state of any
          variable. It even highlights DOM elements in Chromium when you hover
          over a selector expression in VSCode (it works with multi-dot
          selectors too!).
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Playwright also has its own inspector where you can run tests step by
          step while watching them in Chromium. This allows you to evaluate
          selectors in real-time while the test is paused.
        </p>

        {/* Nested selectors comparison */}

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-extrabold mb-4">
          Powerful Nested Selectors
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-2">
          One area where Cypress excels is handling deeply nested selectors.
          Using
          <code>cy.within()</code>, Cypress lets you easily scope commands to a
          specific element, making it easier to interact with complex layouts:
        </p>

        <div className="max-w-80 lg:max-w-full 2xl:max-w-full md:max-w-full sm:max-w-full">
          <SyntaxHighlighter
            language="javascript"
            style={oneDark}
            className="mb-6 rounded-md overflow-auto syntax-highlighter"
          >
            {`cy.get('.first-div').within(() => {
  cy.get('.second-div').within(() => {
    cy.get('.target-element').should('be.visible');
  });
});`}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </div>

        <p className="mb-2">
          Cypressâ€™s <code>cy.within()</code> method allows you to scope commands
          to a specific container, creating more readable, maintainable tests.
          Playwright, however, requires separate <code>locator</code> calls,
          which can make deeply nested selections more verbose and harder to
          follow:
        </p>

        <div className="max-w-80 lg:max-w-full 2xl:max-w-full md:max-w-full sm:max-w-full">
          <SyntaxHighlighter
            language="javascript"
            style={oneDark}
            className="mb-6 rounded-md overflow-auto syntax-highlighter"
          >
            {`const container = await page.locator('.first-div');
const nestedContainer = await container.locator('.second-div');
await nestedContainer.locator('.target-element').isVisible();`}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </div>

        <p className="mb-6">
          While Playwright's syntax is powerful, the lack of a direct equivalent
          to <code>cy.within()</code> means handling complex structures may feel
          more cumbersome, especially in applications with deeply nested
          elements. In such cases, Cypressâ€™s nested selectors provide a smoother
          experience by keeping everything neatly scoped within a single chain.
